# Packages and Libraries

The following packages and libraries are used and installed for developing this project.

- **Material UI**
  <br>This library provides a set of components that are created based on Google's Material UI principles.
  These components make the UI look more sleek and intuitive.

- **React Router**
  <br>This library gives us the functionality to include links in the app.
  Using this library, the user can navigate between the chat, authentication and home pages.

- **Redux**
  <br>Redux is a library for managing the state of app in a single place. Using this, all components can save and read their data from a single store.
  Sharing of data between components also becomes easier.

- **Firebase**
  <br>Firebase is a service provided by Google that allows us to use a backend and database already created for us so that we can focus more on the front end.

- **React Redux Firebase**
  <br>React Redux Firebase acts as an intermediary between Firebase, React and Redux. It provides methods and reducers that make interacting with Firebase databases easier.
