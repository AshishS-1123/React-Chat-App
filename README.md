# React Chat App

This is a messaging app developed using React, Material UI and Firebase

## Design

The mockup for the application has been created using Adobe XD with some borrowed inspiration from the internet.

This is what the final product is expected to look like

<div>
  <style>
    div {
    }
    img {
      width: 49%;
      margin-bottom: 0.5%;
    }
  </style>

  <img src='/design/Home Page.png'>
  <img src='/design/Log In.png'>
  <img src='/design/Sign Up.png'>
  <img src='/design/Chat List Expanded.png'>
  <img src='/design/Chat List Contracted.png'>
</div>
